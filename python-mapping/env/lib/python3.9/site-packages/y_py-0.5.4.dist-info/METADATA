# Ypy

Ypy is a Python binding for Y-CRDT. It provides distributed data types that enable real-time collaboration between devices. Ypy can sync data with any other platform that has a Y-CRDT binding, allowing for seamless cross-domain communication. The library is a thin wrapper around Yrs, taking advantage of the safety and performance of Rust.

> ðŸ§ª Project is still experimental. Expect the API to change before a version 1.0 stable release.

## Installation

```
pip install y-py
```

## Getting Started

Ypy provides many of the same shared data types as [Yjs](https://docs.yjs.dev/). All objects are shared within a `YDoc` and get modified within a transaction block.

```python
import y_py as Y

d1 = Y.YDoc()
# Create a new YText object in the YDoc
text = d1.get_text('test')
# Start a transaction in order to update the text
with d1.begin_transaction() as txn:
    # Add text contents
    text.extend(txn, "hello world!")

# Create another document
d2 = Y.YDoc()
# Share state with the original document
state_vector = Y.encode_state_vector(d2)
diff = Y.encode_state_as_update(d1, state_vector)
Y.apply_update(d2, diff)

value = str(d2.get_text('test'))

assert value == "hello world!"
```

## Development Setup

0. Install Rust and Python
1. Install `maturin` in order to build Ypy

```
pip install maturin
```

2. Create a development build of the library
   `maturin develop`

## Tests

All tests are located in `/tests`. You can run them with `pytest`.

```
pytest
```

## Build Ypy :

Build the library as a wheel and store them in `target/wheels` :

```
maturin build
```
